# Lista de cursos, librerias y plataformas

La siguiente lista corresponde a una serie de cursos, librérías y plataformas disponibles para diseñar y entrenar modelos de recomendación usando Python.


1. Curso Sistemas Recomendadores IIC3633 https://github.com/PUC-RecSys-Class/RecSysPUC-2020

	Profesor: Denis Parra

	El curso de Sistemas Recomendadores cubre las principales tareas de recomendación, algoritmos, fuentes de datos y evaluación de estos sistemas. Al final de este curso serás capaz de decidir qué técnicas y fuentes de datos usar para implementar y evaluar sistemas recomendadores.

1. Plataforma Turi https://github.com/apple/turicreate

	Turi is a graph-based, high performance, distributed computation framework written in C++. The GraphLab project was started by Prof. Carlos Guestrin of Carnegie Mellon University in 2009. It is an open source project using an Apache License. While GraphLab was originally developed for Machine Learning tasks, it has found great success at a broad range of other data-mining tasks; out-performing other abstractions by orders of magnitude.

4. Suprise https://github.com/NicolasHug/Surprise                                                                                                                                            
	Surprise is a Python scikit for building and analyzing recommender systems that deal with explicit rating data.

	Surprise was designed with the following purposes in mind:

	- Give users perfect control over their experiments. To this end, a strong emphasis is laid on documentation, which we have tried to make as clear and precise as possible by pointing out every detail of the algorithms.
	- Alleviate the pain of Dataset handling. Users can use both built-in datasets (Movielens, Jester), and their own custom datasets.
	- Provide various ready-to-use prediction algorithms such as baseline algorithms, neighborhood methods, matrix factorization-based ( SVD, PMF, SVD++, NMF), and many others. Also, various similarity measures (cosine, MSD, pearson...) are built-in.
	- Make it easy to implement new algorithm ideas.
	- Provide tools to evaluate, analyse and compare the algorithms' performance. Cross-validation procedures can be run very easily using powerful CV iterators (inspired by scikit-learn excellent tools), as well as exhaustive search over a set of parameters.
