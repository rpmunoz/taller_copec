Lista de librerias y plataformas para entrenar modelos de recomendacion en Python


1. Turi https://github.com/apple/turicreate

Turi is a graph-based, high performance, distributed computation framework written in C++. The GraphLab project was started by Prof. Carlos Guestrin of Carnegie Mellon University in 2009. It is an open source project using an Apache License. While GraphLab was originally developed for Machine Learning tasks, it has found great success at a broad range of other data-mining tasks; out-performing other abstractions by orders of magnitude.

Surprise is a Python scikit for building and analyzing recommender systems that deal with explicit rating data.

Surprise was designed with the following purposes in mind:

- Give users perfect control over their experiments. To this end, a strong emphasis is laid on documentation, which we have tried to make as clear and precise as possible by pointing out every detail of the algorithms.
- Alleviate the pain of Dataset handling. Users can use both built-in datasets (Movielens, Jester), and their own custom datasets.
- Provide various ready-to-use prediction algorithms such as baseline algorithms, neighborhood methods, matrix factorization-based ( SVD, PMF, SVD++, NMF), and many others. Also, various similarity measures (cosine, MSD, pearson...) are built-in.
- Make it easy to implement new algorithm ideas.
- Provide tools to evaluate, analyse and compare the algorithms' performance. Cross-validation procedures can be run very easily using powerful CV iterators (inspired by scikit-learn excellent tools), as well as exhaustive search over a set of parameters.
